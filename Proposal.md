## Summary

Develop an efficient command-line tool for finding files, similar to the `find` command in the Unix system. In addition to core functions such as recursive search, regular expressions, file name matching, basic filtering, etc., optimize the command-line tool's UI appearance, highlight prompts, parameter naming, output format, etc. to conform to the development and usage habits of modern programmers. According to the subsequent time plan, selectively complete extended functions such as parallel processing, multi-threaded search, and .gitignore support.
